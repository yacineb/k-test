# Level 1

We are building an e-commerce website. Our customers can:
  - add articles to a virtual cart
  - checkout the cart contents
  - get it delivered the next day

The customer is charged the sum of the prices of each article in their cart.

Prices are expressed in cents.

INSTRUCTIONS :
*  `node index.js` should generate a new file `output.json`
*  `output.json` must be equal to `expected_output.json`
