# Level 3

Some products are discounted because of a deal we made with the supplier.

There are two kinds of discounts:
- a direct cut to the article's price, e.g. get 50€ off your 300€ caviar tin and only pay 250€
- a percentage discount, e.g. get 20% off your 5€ creme fraiche and only pay 4€

INSTRUCTIONS :
*  Copy your code from level2 into level3
*  `node index.js` should generate a new file `output.json`
*  `output.json` must be equal to `expected_output.json`
